# Design Pattern Examples

## Strategy Design Pattern
  - defines a family of algorithms
  - encapsulates each algorithm
  - makes the algorithms interchangeable within that family
    - For instance, a class that performs validation on incoming data may use a strategy pattern to select 
        a validation algorithm based on the type of data, the source of the data, user choice, or other discriminating factors. 
        These factors are not known for each case until run-time, and may require radically different validation to be performed. 
        The validation strategies, encapsulated separately from the validating object, may be used by other validating objects in 
        different areas of the system (or even different systems) without code duplication.

## Observer Design Pattern
  - The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called     observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.
  - Used when there is one-to-many relationship between objexts such as if one object is modified, its dependent objects are to be
    notified automatically.
  - Three actor classes -> Subjext, Observer, Client
    - Subject is an object having methods to attach and detach observers to a client object. We have created an abstract class Observer       and a concrete class Subject that is extending class Observer

## Factory Design Pattern
  - "Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. The Factory method lets a class
       defer instantiation it uses to subclasses." (Gang Of Four)
  - Creating an object often requires complex processes not appropriate to include within a composing object. 
    The object's creation may lead to a significant duplication of code, may require information not accessible to the composing object,
    may not provide a sufficient level of abstraction, or may otherwise not be part of the composing object's concerns. 
    The factory method design pattern handles these problems by defining a separate method for creating the objects, 
    which subclasses can then override to specify the derived type of product that will be created.
  - The factory method pattern relies on inheritance, as object creation is delegated to subclasses that implement the factory method to       create objects.

## Abstract Factory Pattern
  - Provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes.
  - In normal usage, the client software creates a concrete implementation of the abstract factory and then uses the generic interface
    of the factory to create the concrete objects that are part of the theme.
      - The client doesn't know (or care) which concrete objects it gets from each of these internal factories, since it uses only the
        generic interfaces of their products.
  - A factory is the location of a concrete class in the code at which objects are constructed.
  - The pattern is best utilised when your system has to create multiple families of products or you want to provide a library of
    products without exposing the implementation details. As you'll have noticed, a key characteristic is that the pattern will decouple
    the concrete classes from the client. 
      - An example of an Abstract Factory in use could be UI toolkits. Across Windows, Mac and Linux, UI composites such as windows,
        buttons and textfields are all provided in a widget API like SWT. However, the implementation of these widgets vary across
        platforms. You could write a platform independent client thanks to the Abstract Factory implementation.

## Singleton Pattern
  - Singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class and ensures that only one instance of the class exists in the java virtual
    machine.
  - The singleton class must provide a global access point to get the instance of the class.
  - Singleton pattern is used for logging, drivers objects, caching and thread pool.
  - To implement Singleton pattern, we have different approaches but all of them have following common concepts.
    - Private constructor to restrict instantiation of the class from other classes.
    - Private static variable of the same class that is the only instance of the class.
    - Public static method that returns the instance of the class, this is the global access point for outer world to get the instance
      of the singleton class.
    - Allow multiple instances in the future without affecting a singleton class's clients.
  - The abstract factory, builder, and prototype patterns can use Singletons in their implementation.
  - Facade objects are often singletons because only one Facade object is required.
  - State objects are often singletons.
  - Singletons are often preferred to global variables because:
      - They do not pollute the global namespace (or, in languages with namespaces, their containing namespace) with unnecessary
        variables.
      - They permit lazy allocation and initialization, whereas global variables in many languages will always consume resources.

## Builder Design Pattern
  - The intent of the Builder design pattern is to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation. By doing so
    the same construction process can create different representations.
  - The builder pattern is an object creation software design pattern.
  - Unlike the abstract factory pattern and the factory method pattern whose intention is to enable polymorphism, the intention of the
    builder pattern is to find a solution to the telescoping constructor anti-pattern
  - Builder often builds a Composite. 
  - Often, designs start out using Factory Method (less complicated, more customizable, subclasses
    proliferate) and evolve toward Abstract Factory, Prototype, or Builder (more flexible, more complex) as the designer discovers where
    more flexibility is needed.
  - Advantages:
    - Allows you to vary a productâ€™s internal representation.
    - Encapsulates code for construction and representation.
    - Provides control over steps of construction process.
  - Disadvantages:
    - Requires creating a separate ConcreteBuilder for each different type of Product.
    - Requires the builder classes to be mutable.
  - The builder pattern has another benefit. It can be used for objects that contain flat data (html code, SQL query, X.509
    certificate...), that is to say, data that can't be easily edited. This type of data can't be edited step by step and must be edited
    at once.
  - Builder: Abstract interface for creating objects (product).
  - ConcreteBuilder: Provides implementation for Builder. It is an object able to construct other objects. Constructs and assembles
    parts to build the objects.
