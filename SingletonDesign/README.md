# Singleton Design Patterns
- Used when you want to eliminate the option of instantiating more than on object

## Example 1 - ScrabbleTest
  - Demonstrates a class that holds all the potential Scrabble letters and spits out new ones up request.
    - Each player will share the same potential letter list
    - Each player has their own set of letters
  
## Example 2 - SingletonPatternTest
  - Simple example of a SingleObject class that can only be instantiated once
